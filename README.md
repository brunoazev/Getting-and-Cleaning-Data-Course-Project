# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal was to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

## Reading the data

Use the following function to read the data into R:

data <- read.table("tidydata.txt",header=TRUE)
